Creating a scenario:
--------------------
 There is a war going between two countries. The submarine of one country is going in underwater to another country. The enemy country have planted some mines(explosives)
 in the ocean that explodes when some object comes in contact with it. Here submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing a rock or a mine.
 
Our job here:
--------------
 Our job here is to make system that can predict whether the object beneath submarine is rock or mine.
 
How its done?
--------------
 submarine uses sonar that sends sound signals and receives it back, So this signal is then processed to detect whether the object is a mine or just a rock in the ocean.

Workflow of this project:
-------------------------
1) Collecting Sonar Data for rock and mine 
2) Data preprocessing 
3) Splitting the data into train and test data
4) Feeding the data to machine learning model.
5) Here we are using Logistic regression model as it is binary classification model.
6) We get trained logistic regression model which is used further, When we feed new data to this model it will pedict whether it is a mine or rock.
